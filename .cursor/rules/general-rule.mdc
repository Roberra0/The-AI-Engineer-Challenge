## Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code. 
- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions in a simple structured way with high level decription and a deeper through description to help the user abstract, as they are new to development.
